It looks for pngs and jpgs in the "images" folder, and to call a background to be shown, you write the name after scene, including spaces, but not including file type. Images files must also be all lower case. A transition can be specified using the "with" key word after the file name, and then the built in transition.

A fadein/fadeout can be specified after the file name, as well as volume. You can also play "sound" and "voice" with the three together basically serving as 3 different audio channels.
